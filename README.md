# Story-Vineyard
Story Vineyard is a graphical outlining tool, designed to give writers an easily digestible birds eye view of their project. It is a single page application, with various events triggering AJAX calls to the Rails API on the backend.
To check it out, fork and clone this repository, then navigate into the backend folder. Run bundle install, rails db:migrate, and rails s to start up the server. Open the index.html file from the frontend folder in your browser of choice. I recomend viewing the tutorial to get a better feel for the use of this application, then make a user account to start experimenting with the graphical intereface.
